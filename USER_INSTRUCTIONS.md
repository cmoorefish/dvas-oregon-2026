📖 DVAS User Instructions: 2026 District 52 Pilot
This guide explains how candidates, donors, and voters interact with the Digital Verification and Auditing System (DVAS) to ensure a transparent, foreign-influence-free election.

🗳️ For Candidates: The "Compliance Dashboard"
Why: To automate the vetting of donors and ensure 100% compliance with Oregon’s 2026 election laws before filing with ORESTAR.

How:

Integration: Link your donation page to the DVAS API.

Real-Time Vetting: As donations come in, the dashboard displays a "Verification Status."

✅ Verified: Donor has proven citizenship/eligibility via Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP).

⚠️ Flagged: Donor has not provided a digital proof (potential foreign/shell company risk).

Audit Readiness: At the end of the reporting period, export your "DVAS Proof Bundle" to submit alongside your ORESTAR filings.

💰 For Donors: The "Privacy-First Proof"
Why: To prove you are a legal, eligible donor (and not a foreign entity) without having to reveal your private ID or home address to the campaign or the public.

How:

The Prompt: When you donate, you will see a "Verify with DVAS" button.

Local Verification: Use your device to scan your ID or log in via your state-verified portal.

Generate Proof: DVAS creates a mathematical proof on your device. Only the proof (not your data) is sent to the candidate's ledger.

Result: You receive a "Digital Receipt of Eligibility" that serves as your legal shield for the contribution.

👤 For Voters: The "Transparency Ledger"
Why: To see exactly where a candidate's money is coming from with 100% certainty that the "Dark Money" loopholes have been closed.

How:

Access the Ledger: Visit the public DVAS portal for District 52.

Review the Data: You won't see individual names (protecting privacy), but you will see a live count of "Verified Human Donors."

Verify the Auditor: You can click on any transaction hash to see the mathematical verification that the funds were cleared by a U.S. citizen.

Report Anomalies: If a candidate has a high volume of "Unverified" funds, the system provides a direct link to file a concern with the Secretary of State's office.

🏛️ For Auditors: The "Immutable Trail"
Why: To reduce the manual workload of verifying thousands of individual donations by relying on cryptographic certainty.

How:

Bulk Validation: Instead of checking individual IDs, auditors run a script against the DVAS ledger to verify that all mathematical proofs are valid.

Foreign Influence Detection: The system automatically highlights any funding spikes that lack the "Citizenship Proof" signature.
